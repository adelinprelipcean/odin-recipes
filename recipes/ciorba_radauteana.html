                <li>2 egg yolks</li>
                <li>230 grams (1 cup) sour cream</li>
                <li>Juice from 1 lemon</li>

        <div class="steps">Steps:</div>
            <ol>
                <li>In a soup pot, add 3 or 4 litres of water and the chicken parts. The water amount depends on your soup pot size. Boil for at least 1 hour, skimming the foam each time it rises to the surface.</li>
                <li>Add the carrots, celery root, parsnip, onion, and boil for 30-45 minutes, or until the vegetables are cooked.</li>
                <li>Remove the vegetables and the meat from the pot. Discard the onion and the parsnip. Shred the carrots and the celery root with a grater, and chop the chicken meat into pieces. Put the vegetables and meat back in the pot.</li>
                <li>Put 2 ladles of soup in a bowl and let them cool for 2-3 minutes.</li>
                <li>In another bowl, beat the egg yolks and mix with the sour cream. Press the garlic and add it to the cream mixture. Gradually add the 2 ladles of soup and whisk well. This will help temper the sour cream mixture, so that it won’t curdle.</li>
                <li>Add the lemon juice, salt and pepper to taste, and let the soup boil for another 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Turn off the heat, then add the sour cream mixture while stirring continuously with a whisk.</li>
                <li>Add the finely chopped parsley and serve.</li>
            </ol>
